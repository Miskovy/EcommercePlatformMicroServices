in a microservices architecture, the best practice is Database per Service. This allows you to pick the best tool for the job (Polyglot Persistence).

User Service: PostgreSQL (Relational is best for structured user data and relationships).

Product Service: MongoDB (NoSQL is excellent for flexible product schemas and catalog attributes).

Shopping Cart: Redis (Key-value store is fastest for temporary, volatile data like active carts).

Order Service: PostgreSQL (ACID compliance is strictly required for financial transactions).

Payment Service: PostgreSQL (Transaction logs) + Stripe/PayPal SDKs.
